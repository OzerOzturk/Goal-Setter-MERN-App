# Goal-Setter-MERN-App
The main goal is to learn MERN Stack with the goal setter project. Huge thanks to [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) for his contributions to the dev community.

In which subjects did I have the opportunity to develop myself?
- Build a Rest API with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Create a login and register endpoint, get a [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (JWT), use this token to access protected routes.
- CRUD operations for our goals.
- Use redux toolkit to manage our global state.
